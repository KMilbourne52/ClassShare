The same rules apply in both cases, whether they are outside or inside of the network. ZTNA is the primary technology connected with the Zero Trust security model. However, this type of security has a holistic way of dealing with network security by using a few different technologies and principles.<\/p>\n<p>To make this easier to understand: the most used IT network security will trust anything and anyone who is already inside the network. Zero Trust security is a bit different because it trusts no one and nothing, regardless of whether they are in the network.<\/p>\n<p>Traditional IT security is founded on the well-known castle-and-moat concept. In the case of this security, it is tough to get gain access to the network from outside. However, everyone inside the network will be trusted by default. A simple method of security like this one could be very effective, but once the intruder gets access to a network, they are able to do anything they want. This type of security is effective until the attacker gains access. After that, it will be like the security was never there for that one particular intruder.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-3465 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.techprocomp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/zero-trust-content-image2.webp\" alt=\"\" width=\"750\" height=\"422\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.techprocomp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/zero-trust-content-image2.webp 750w, https:\/\/www.techprocomp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/zero-trust-content-image2-300x169.webp 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<\/div>\r\n                        <!-- Read more section -->\r\n                                                    <span id=\"read-more\" class=\"d-block cursor-pointer read-more-style mb-4 text-white\">Read more&#8230;<\/span>\r\n                            <div id=\"read-more-content\" class=\"service-content-block-right-description\"><p>This vulnerability in previously mentioned security systems is made even worse by the fact that most companies no longer have their data in only one place. Today, information is often spread across several cloud vendors. This means having just one security control for an entire network is very difficult. It might be possible to manage this, but it certainly wouldn&#8217;t be as effective as it should be.<\/p>\n<p>When it comes to Zero Trust measures regarding security, not one device or user will be trusted without verification, whether they try to gain access to something on the network from the inside or outside. On top of that, verification is mandatory for everyone trying to get access to resources on the network. This extra layer of security has been proven very effective in preventing data breaches. Studies have shown that data breaches can be expensive, and the average cost of a single data breach is over $3 million in most cases. It shouldn&#8217;t be a surprise that many organizations are now eager to implement Zero Trust security policies.<\/p>\n<h3>Main principles behind the Zero Trust<\/h3>\n<h4>Constant validation and monitoring<\/h4>\n<p>The system behind Zero Trust assumes that there will always be potential intruders from outside and inside of the network, meaning no users or devices should or will be automatically trusted. Zero Trust must verify everything, including user identity, privileges, device security, and identity. Every logged-in user and device will time out eventually. This will force previously mentioned users and devices to go through the verification steps over and over again. The reason for this is to increase security as much as possible.<\/p>\n<h4>Least privilege<\/h4>\n<p>The least privilege is one more principle behind zero trust security. To simplify this, users will only get access to what they need. They won&#8217;t have access to everything on the network if they don&#8217;t truly need some data. If we were to give an example of this, it would be almost like when an army general gives soldiers information on a need-to-know basis. This prevents each user from gaining access to sections of the network that might be sensitive if not required.<\/p>\n<p>Using least privilege involves strict managing of permissions for users. VPNs are not suitable for least privilege approaches to authorization, as logging in to a VPN gives a user access to the whole connected network.<\/p>\n<h4>Device access control<\/h4>\n<p>Rigorous policies are put in place when it comes to access regarding Zero Trust security. This type of security also requires more righteous controls on access. Zero Trust systems have multiple tasks at the same time. Systems will have to constantly pay attention to how many unauthorized devices are trying to get access to their private network, make sure that all devices are verified and authorized, and evaluate all devices to ensure that they haven\u2019t been compromised. The reason for this prolonged process is to minimize the network&#8217;s attack surface.<\/p>\n<h4>Micro-segmentation<\/h4>\n<p>Zero Trust networks also utilize micro-segmentation. What this does is basically divide security into smaller zones to control different access for various network parts. Here is an example of that. A network with files in only one data storage that uses micro-segmentation may have numerous secure yet separate zones. A device or a user which has access to mentioned zones won&#8217;t be able to gain access to any of the other parts without additional authorization.<\/p>\n<h4>Prevention of lateral movement<\/h4>\n<p>In terms of network security, lateral movement is a situation when an intruder moves inside a network after getting access to a network. It can be challenging to detect a lateral movement even if the intruder\u2019s point of entry is discovered right away. It would be difficult to find the lateral movement because the intruder will compromise other parts of the network in the meantime.<\/p>\n<p>This type of security is designed to contain intruders, so they aren\u2019t allowed move laterally. Zero Trust has access that needs to be renewed occasionally. This is the reason why an intruder can\u2019t move across to other microsegments inside the network. Once the intruder&#8217;s presence is noticed, the device or user account that was compromised can be quarantined, and further access to the network can be severed. Quarantining the original compromised device or user has almost no effect in a castle-and-moat model. If lateral movement is not disabled for the attacker, the intruder will already have reached other parts of the network.<\/p>\n<h4>Multi-factor authentication (MFA)<\/h4>\n<p>MFA is also a Zero Trust security core value. MFA requires multiple pieces of evidence to verify a user. Typing in a password is simply not enough to gain access. The most used application of this authentication is the 2FA (2-factor authorization) used on online platforms like Facebook and Google. Most people have experienced this while paying for something online. On top of entering the required information, people who turn on 2FA for some services must also type in a security code that is sent to a mobile phone in most cases. This code will provide a second piece of evidence that will verify the user\u2019s identity.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-2139\" src=\"https:\/\/www.techprocomp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/multi-factor-authenication.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"750\" height=\"499\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.techprocomp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/multi-factor-authenication.jpg 750w, https:\/\/www.techprocomp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/multi-factor-authenication-300x200.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>History of Zero Trust Security<\/h3>\n<p>The term &#8220;Zero Trust&#8221; was made by an analyst at Forrester Research Inc. back in 2010 when the model for the concept was first introduced. A couple of years later, Google announced that they had enforced Zero Trust in their network, which led to a growing interest in its adoption within the tech community generally. A global research and advisory firm, Gartner, listed Zero Trust security access as a core component of SASE (secure access service edge) solutions in 2019.<\/p>\n<h3>What is ZTNA (Zero Trust Network Access)?<\/h3>\n<p>ZTNA (Zero Trust Network Access) is the primary technology that enables institutions to implement Zero Trust security. It is very similar to an SDP (software-defined perimeter), meaning Zero Trust Network Access conceals most services and infrastructure, setting up one-to-one encrypted connections between the resources they need and devices.<\/p>\n<h3>How to enforce Zero Trust security<\/h3>\n<p>Zero Trust may sound very complex to some people but implementing this advanced security model can be very simple with the right provider.
