They can save you from a lot of trouble and determine whether your business will be on the rise or not. If you aren&#8217;t informed about cloud firewalls, you came to the right place because you will see all the advantages and how this useful software can help you more than you can think.<\/p>\n<h3>What is a cloud firewall?<\/h3>\n<p>We&#8217;ve all heard of regular firewalls, which is pretty much what cloud firewalls are. They are software-based devices made in order to stop unwanted access to your private network. Cloud firewalls are designed for modern needs and can be found in an online environment. Unlike the regular firewall that&#8217;s installed on your computer or server, these firewalls are hosted in the cloud.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-3377\" src=\"https:\/\/www.techprocomp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/What-is-a-cloud-firewall-cyber-security.webp\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.techprocomp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/What-is-a-cloud-firewall-cyber-security.webp 800w, https:\/\/www.techprocomp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/What-is-a-cloud-firewall-cyber-security-300x169.webp 300w, https:\/\/www.techprocomp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/What-is-a-cloud-firewall-cyber-security-768x432.webp 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<\/div>\r\n                        <!-- Read more section -->\r\n                                                    <span id=\"read-more\" class=\"d-block cursor-pointer read-more-style mb-4 text-white\">Read more&#8230;<\/span>\r\n                            <div id=\"read-more-content\" class=\"service-content-block-right-description\"><h3>Benefits of a cloud firewall<\/h3>\n<p><strong> Scalability:<\/strong> The deployment of a cloud firewall is much simpler, which means any organization that is using this software can adjust the size of required security without the need for on-site installation, regular maintenance, and constant upgrading. Cloud firewalls can automatically adjust if the bandwidth increases.<\/p>\n<p><strong> Availability:<\/strong> Cloud firewalls guarantee redundant power, network services, and automated backup strategies in the event of a failure on site because providers account for the built-in high availability by supporting infrastructure. It&#8217;s tough to match availability with an on-site firewall because the cost would always be higher, and constant support would be needed. This also means that the on-site firewall would need regular updates, unlike immediately implemented ones in the cloud firewall.<\/p>\n<p><strong> Extensibility:<\/strong> Any organization providing protected network communication can have a cloud firewall installed. In the case of an on-site device, this extensibility would be heavily limited by the company&#8217;s available resources.<\/p>\n<p><strong> Migration security:<\/strong> One of the perks of using a cloud firewall is being able to filter traffic from different sources. In other words, a cloud firewall can filter traffic from the internet, virtual data centers, between networks, and between tenants. This software can guarantee the security of connections between physical centers and the cloud. This could be very beneficial for companies looking for a way to migrate current on-site solutions to a cloud.<\/p>\n<p><strong> Secure access parity:<\/strong> Cloud firewalls can provide the same level of security as on-site firewalls. Cloud firewalls allow advanced access policy, better connection management, and filtering between the cloud and clients.<\/p>\n<p><strong> Identity protection:<\/strong> Cloud firewalls can be integrated with access control providers and give users control over tools for filtering.<\/p>\n<p><strong> Performance management:<\/strong> Cloud firewalls give you access to tools used for controlling performance, usage, configuration, visibility, and logging. All these things are usually linked with an on-site solution.<\/p>\n<h3>Types of Cloud Firewall<\/h3>\n<p>You can find two types of cloud firewalls. The distinction can be defined by what users need help securing. Both of these types are cloud-based software that can monitor all outgoing and incoming data and filter all this information against current policies with the purpose of blocking unwanted and suspicious traffic.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>SaaS Firewall<\/strong> is designed to secure a company&#8217;s network and its users, unlike the traditional hardware and software firewall. The primary and only difference is that it&#8217;s deployed from the cloud. This type of firewall has multiple names:\n<ul class=\"mb-3\">\n<li>SaaS firewall (Software-as-a-service)<\/li>\n<li>SECaaS (Security-as-a-service)<\/li>\n<li>FWaaS (Firewall-as-a-service)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li><strong>Next-Gen firewall<\/strong> is a cloud-based service intended to deploy within a virtual data center. This firewall protects the company&#8217;s servers in a PaaS (platform-as-a-service) or IaaS (Infrastructure-as-a-service) model. This firewall can be found on a virtual server, and it secures outgoing and incoming traffic between cloud-based applications.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Potential cloud firewall risks<\/h3>\n<p>There could be one potential downside to any cloud firewall, and that is that users have to rely on the availability of a FaaS provider. Multiple companies could be exposed to security breaches if the cloud firewall service provider encounters some issues. This is the main reason why numerous service providers have a security team in charge of responding to problems like these.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-2119\" src=\"https:\/\/www.techprocomp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/cloud-firewall-risks.webp\" alt=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1277\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.techprocomp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/cloud-firewall-risks.webp 1920w, https:\/\/www.techprocomp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/cloud-firewall-risks-300x200.webp 300w, https:\/\/www.techprocomp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/cloud-firewall-risks-1024x681.webp 1024w, https:\/\/www.techprocomp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/cloud-firewall-risks-768x511.webp 768w, https:\/\/www.techprocomp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/cloud-firewall-risks-1536x1022.webp 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>Why you should use FWaaS<\/h3>\n<p>We can use banks as an example to explain the advantages of using cloud firewalls. Most banks use security cameras, bulletproof glass, and security guards to stop potential thieves, and they store large sums of money in a secure safe so no one can take it. Now imagine if all that cash was held in various banks all over the country. The bank would have to use additional security to keep an eye on all that cash.<br \/>\nThe cloud could be represented as a bank with resources all over the country, but they store data instead of money. Only authorized users can connect to the cloud from anywhere on most networks. A Cloud firewall is implemented to block cyber-attacks and unauthorized access because all that secure data is critical to a specific company. Imagine replacing a bank&#8217;s security system and a security guard with a security center available 24\/7 to monitor everything going on there. That&#8217;s precisely what a cloud firewall is for data storage. They are protected every minute of the day without any need for physical assistance on-site.<\/p>\n<h3>How does FWaaS fit into the SASE framework?<\/h3>\n<p>SASE (secure access service edge) is a networking architecture that combines functions like WANs with a set of security services, including FWaaS. SASE offers comprehensive security and access control at the network edge, unlike the traditional models where on-site firewalls have to be used to protect on-site data.<br \/>\nThe cloud-based firewall works in tandem with other security products to defend network perimeters from data breaches, attacks, and other cyber threats. Companies can use a single vendor that bundles FWaaS instead of using several vendors to maintain and deploy services. A Cloud firewall is made to protect both cloud and on-site infrastructure via the global network.<\/p>\n<h3>Should you opt for Cloud Firewall?<\/h3>\n<p>It\u2019s all up to you whether you should opt for Cloud Firewall from TechProComp service.
