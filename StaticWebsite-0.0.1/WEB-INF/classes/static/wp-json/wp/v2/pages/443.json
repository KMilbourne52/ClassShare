If we look at organizations that remain consistently successful amid many economic and world events that could critically jeopardize their business, one thing is obvious \u2013 consistency and continuity.<\/p>\n<p>But what does this mean for you? The answer is simple \u2013 it means keeping your business up and running without the downtime and undeterred, despite any adverse circumstance. Business continuity instills a sense of trust of a consumer in your products and services, and creates loyalty and ultimately, revenue.<\/p>\n<p>The benefits of operating optimally and without downtime are difficult to overstate, and one of the main things that need to be in place to ensure this is a good backup and recovery plan.<\/p>\n<p>A well-formulated backup and recovery plan predicts and mitigates scenarios such as:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Theft of devices<\/li>\n<li>Theft of data<\/li>\n<li>Data corruption<\/li>\n<li>Malicious threats and attacks<\/li>\n<li>Natural disasters (fires, floods, earthquakes)<\/li>\n<li>The electrical outage caused issues<\/li>\n<li>Data lost by accident<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>As previously mentioned, the ability to recover and back up your IT systems and data infrastructure cannot be overstated \u2013 it is literally one of the most important layers of protection any serious business needs to have to operate normally. Even a downtime of a few minutes can lead to damages to your business and revenue and loss of trust in the industry.<\/p>\n<p>What can you do now? We have a backup solution that will keep your business running 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Under our Backup and Recovery package, we at TechProComp offer the following services:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Local Backup (NAS, SAN)<\/li>\n<li>Local and Cloud Backup (Infrastructure, Workstations)<\/li>\n<li>Automatic backup that does not slow down your network<\/li>\n<li>Instant Restore<\/li>\n<li>Windows 365 backup<\/li>\n<li>G Suite Backup<\/li>\n<li>AWS Backup<\/li>\n<li>Azure Backup<\/li>\n<li>Website Backup<\/li>\n<li>Reporting<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Our team of experts will identify key points that we will mark as \u201crisk areas\u201d and work on a plan to prevent any issues for you. We will create a list of priorities and essential systems for your business and go from there \u2013 creating a perfect action plan for your needs. This action plan will encompass a hierarchy of systems and recovery policies assigned to each, ordered by how essential they are to run your business.
